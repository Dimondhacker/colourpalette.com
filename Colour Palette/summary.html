      <H3>Drawing,</H3> The art or technique of producing images on a surface, usually paper, by means of marks, usually of ink, graphite, chalk, charcoal, or crayon.
      <br><br>Drawing as formal artistic creation might be defined as the primarily linear rendition of objects in the visible world, as well as of concepts, thoughts, attitudes, emotions, and fantasies given visual form, of symbols and even of abstract forms.
    <br><br>This definition, however, applies to all graphic arts and techniques that are characterized by an emphasis on form or shape rather than mass and colour, as in painting.
    <br><br>Drawing as such differs from graphic printing processes in that a direct relationship exists between production and result.
    <br><br>Drawing, in short, is the end product of a successive effort applied directly to the carrier.
    <br><br>Whereas a drawing may form the basis for reproduction or copying, it is nonetheless unique by its very nature.
    <br><br>Although not every artwork has been preceded by a drawing in the form of a preliminary sketch, drawing is in effect the basis of all visual arts.
    <br><br>Often the drawing is absorbed by the completed work or destroyed in the course of completion.
    <br>Thus, the usefulness of a ground plan drawing of a building that is to be erected decreases as the building goes up.
    <br><br>Similarly, points and lines marked on a raw stone block represent auxiliary drawings for the sculpture that will be hewn out of the material.
